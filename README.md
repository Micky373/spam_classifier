# Spam Message Classifier

> In this repo I have done an end to end spam message classifier. In the website a user can pass the message and the model will predict whether the email is spam or ham. I have used a labeled data to train my model and streamlit for the UI and deployment. 

The spam messages data contains more than 5000 labeled messages.

messages in the box and check.
